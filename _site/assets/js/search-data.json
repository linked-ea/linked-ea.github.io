    "content": "To some extent, every single architecture initiative that is based on an Enterprise Architecture model starts from scratch, and typically locked to an software tool or service. Through the selected tool, an architecture metamodel is defined (or adopted from standards like Archimate®), architecture domains are identified, template diagrams are developed, and architecture data to be used is identified, activities that become as time consuming as the architecture initiative itself, before the actual work starts. It feels like a significant amount of effort even before the first architecture artifact is captured. The metaphor I to use is that “the construction of road that takes us to the to-be built facility is bigger than the facility itself”. As a result, business organizations developed a “traumatic disorder” in respect to architecture initiatives, perceiving the benefits being small than the effort and costs. Often enterprise architecture teams are assembled and disassembled due to their perceived cost/benefit, and organizations unknowingly (or accepting it) loose tacit and coded knowledge of their business, information and technnology architectures.

You can easily set the created site to be published on GitHub Pages – the README file explains how to do that, along with other details. If Jekyll is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site locally. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.1 And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages. More specifically, the created site: . | uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a Gemfile and loads the just-the-docs gem | uses the GitHub Pages / Actions workflow to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages | . Other than that, you’re free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of just-the-docs and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins. Browse our documentation to learn more about how to use this theme. To get started with creating a site, simply: . | click “use this template” to create a GitHub repository | go to Settings &gt; Pages &gt; Build and deployment &gt; Source, and select GitHub Actions | .
