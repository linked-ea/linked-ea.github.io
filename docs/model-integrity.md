# Model Integrity
{: .no_toc }

The general rule is that no resource can be removed from the model if:

* It is being referenced by other resource (e.g. Specializations reference by Elements)
* It has a relationship to other resource

For removal of resources, references and/or relationships need to be eliminated in advance.
