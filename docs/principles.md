# Principles
{: .no_toc }

* * Develop a set of proof-of-concept specifications, best practices, and implementations to link enterprise architecture models
* Leverage Archimate® modeling language - it is the most prevalent across EA practitioner community
* It is conformant with  [ArchiMate 3.2 Conformance documents](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/archimate3-doc/ch-Introduction.html#sec-Conformance)[^1]
* It will not re-invent the wheel - leverage existing standards and approaches
* Decoupled from existing commercial product - based on Open Source technologies to allow unrestricted usage

## Terminology

For the purposes of this project, the following terminology definitions apply:

* Can - Describes a possible feature or behavior available to the user.
Deprecated
Items identified as deprecated may be removed in the next version of this standard.
Implementation-defined
Describes a value or behavior that is not defined by this standard but is selected by an implementor of a software tool. The value or behavior may vary among implementations that conform to this standard. A user should not rely on the existence of the value or behavior. The implementor shall document such a value or behavior so that it can be used correctly by a user.
May
Describes a feature or behavior that is optional. To avoid ambiguity, the opposite of “may” is expressed as “need not”, instead of “may not”.
Obsolescent
Certain features are obsolescent, which means that they may be considered for withdrawal in future versions of this standard. They are retained because of their widespread use, but their use is discouraged.
Shall
Describes a feature or behavior that is a requirement. To avoid ambiguity, do not use “must” as an alternative to “shall”.
Shall not
Describes a feature or behavior that is an absolute prohibition.
Should
Describes a feature or behavior that is recommended but not required.
Will
Same meaning as “shall”; “shall” is the preferred term.
